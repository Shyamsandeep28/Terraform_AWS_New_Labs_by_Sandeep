# 🚀 Terraform Hands-On Labs – Complete Beginner to Advanced Series

### **Author: Dr. Sandeep Kumar Sharma**

Welcome to the **Terraform Labs Repository** — a complete, structured, end-to-end learning path designed for beginners, intermediate learners, and professionals preparing for real-world Terraform + AWS projects.

This repository contains **step-by-step, production-ready, instructor-style labs** created in a natural, easy-to-understand teaching format. If you follow these labs in order, you will confidently master Terraform from zero to advanced.

---

# 🌟 Why This Repository?

Most Terraform tutorials stop at beginner level. Real production infrastructure requires:

* modules
* workspaces
* remote state
* VPC design
* autoscaling setups
* load balancers
* security and IAM
* data sources
* tfvars

This repository bridges that gap.
You will learn Terraform **as if sitting inside a live corporate training session.**
